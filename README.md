# Serverless toll

## What is this

Creates a serverless backend for the very annoying Seattle Tolls

## Motivation

Seattle tolls can get upsettingly expensive, and there is no good, quick, or easy way to check how much the toll is ahead of time
So I'm writing this backend in order to check the prices of the 99 tunnel and the 520 bridge

## What you need

This backend utilizes the serverless framework and the AWS infrostructure
So you will need to install the serverless cli, have a serverless account and an AWS account
